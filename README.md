# pacman_2077
PACMAN but with guns !!!!

# requirements
used standard binaries : 
1. stdio.h
2. SDL.h
3. SDL_ttf
4. pthread.h
5. time.h
6. stdint.h
7. netinet/in.h
8. arpa/inet.h
9. string.h
10. cstdlib
11. iostream
12. unistd.h
13. sys/types.h
14. sys/wait.h
15. sys/socket.h
16. netdb.h
17. signal.h
18. stdlib.h
-> all except SDL_ttf.h and SDL.h are standard c++ libraries, and hence do not require any extra installation

# compiiling and running the game
in the console enter:
-> `make`  : to compile the code
-> `./game <maze_code>` : to run the generated executable (here the "maze_code" is the seed used to generate the maze and hence the same maze_code must be entered by all clients and the server to be able to play the game together

# rules of the game
-> the game can be played by a maximum of 10 players (1 pacman and 9 demons)
-> the server takes the role of pacman
-> each client is a demon
-> all players (demons or pacman) can move freely in all four directions using the arrow keys, as long as they are not being blocked by a wall
-> pacman needs to eat all the coins spread throughout the maze to win
-> demons must collectively kill the pacman a total of 5 times to win
-> all players (demons and pacman) can shoot bullets in their current direction of movement using the "z" key.
-> demons win if pacman dies 5 times, hence pacman must play smart to survive
-> however, demons must stay careful, pacman shoots bullets too

# features
-> data transmission between the server and client over udp
-> SDL rendering of frames generated by a mosaic of textures
-> large possible maze structures (user can choose to replay an old maze by entering the correct maze_code)
-> kill count maintained for each player
-> no closed loops can be formed in the maze to prevent pacman from spawning into an unwinnable situation

# issues faced
1. since maze was to be randomly generated it needed to use the same seed for all the game clients on the same server =>
the players need to enter the same maze_code which is used as a seed to run the game 
2. coins are consumed by pacman, so are hence only removed on comsumption on the server side =>
only the server renders coins, clients use a different rendering procedure which does not render coins
